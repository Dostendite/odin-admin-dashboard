# Admin Dashboard for TOP

ðŸ‘¾ [**Live preview**](https://dostendite.github.io/odin-admin-dashboard/)

**Capstone project** for The Odin Project's *Intermediate HTML & CSS course*!

## Conclusion

This one was definitely not hard to build, but not easy
either, it was a bit spooky starting from a blank slate,
but little by little I added the elements & understood how
to play around with the grid properties to get the layouts
I wanted, which led me to this.

Overall, I'm really happy I kept going with TOP and am grateful for the help & guidance of the folks over at the Discord server, like X AJ X, Carlos, Mao, Taladan, Chris, and many more!
